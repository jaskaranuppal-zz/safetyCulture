SafetyCulture coding challenge

Tried to implement the coding challenge in about 2 hours.
Data is being read from Model.json to create a JSONArray and then on each JSONObject we get the id and the temperature.
Defined methods to calculate average, median, mode(s)

Have some ideas to abstract out the code from the main.java and adding test cases as well.
